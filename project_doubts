Doubts -> App Monitors data(voice/text), but does it convert data to text?
       -> App pushes data(voice/text) will it send data as text or voice? if voice what about latency issue?
          data transfer rate?
       -> which part(App/Backend) detects user, i.e dentifies user voice, for e.g if we four are having conversation
          then will app try to detect user by voice or would it just send the data to server and server would do the work?
       -> Would we require training dataset to detect user? if yes how much is enough?
       -> Text to speach done at the client or server side?
       -> Takes a searchable voice query to fetch the data from the server!!!
       -> When searching data(voice/text) from database or getting data(voice/text), what will it return? 
          exact part for whole voice/text
       -> will it try to makes sense and give further searching on what is one saying? i.e do we analyase the voice text 
          and find important keywords for faster retrieval 
       -> Do we need to have api for push/search data? which language we would be using?
          Flask and python?
       -> Graphdb seems to be appropriate this! Can retrive data almost as we needed.
