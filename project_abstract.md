Problem: For various types of gatherings/meetings explicit effort is taken to document it. 
For example, in a courtroom hearing, a dedicated person is appointed to record the entire 
judgement in written format. One more problem assosiated with such gatherings/meetings is 
that it becomes very tedious to search through all the previous records. Here I am not just 
talkin about FTS(full text search) but also some stuctured search. For example, what if I 
want to search about what Prof Ranjan taught us in the 272 class room X weeks back on Y 
topic/keyword?

Solution: We provide an integrated solution where in the entire conversation is recording
with separation of different individuals. The solution is not tied to a particular usecase 
but can be altered to better suit a need. 
Our solution will not only [1] help document the meetings but will also [2] provide some cool
analytics (need to refine this particular point) and [3] will also make all the previous 
data searchable. We aim to provide each individual with a small IoT device [the prototype 
thought may be not that small because of discrete components like a raspberry pie] OR a phone 
app which will listen continously when the app is switched on and feed it our servers.


Efforts needed and the person driving it:
1. Android app [Madhur]
2. Serverside logic [Aditi]
3. Web UI for analytics [Shafi?]
4. IoT device [Chaya?]
